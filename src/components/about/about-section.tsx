              <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              In conclusion, the TradeMinds team has implemented a platform that allows for the user to upload models, view model visualizations, provide feedbacks as well as like models, and secure user authorization information. We believe that for the future work we can implement new ideas, as well as improve upon the current system. These ideas include having a more robust model upload feature that does not have as many constraints on the way the models needs to be uploaded and adding additional visualization for every model on their respective model page so that the user’s have more visual aids to improve knowledge and information about each model.
